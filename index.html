      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am 24 years old. I live with my husband, my son, and our big dog. We recently just bought our first house.
        <br/>It has been an exciting year! I think 2020 will be even more exciting because I will be participating in Coding Boot Camp.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Rolling Meadows, Illionois. I moved to Wisconsin in 2010.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love binge watching Netflix and listening to podcast. My favorite posdcast is Unsolicited Advice. 
        <br/>
      I also love doing jigsaw puzzles. The harder and more complicated the better!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to be a Front End Web Developer or a software Developer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in West Allis, Wisconsin.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I believe being a Web Developer will suit my personality, skills, and traits. I am a problem solver and I consider myslef to be a creative person.
        <br/>This career path also also give me the flexibility to work freelance or as part of an organisation.
        <br/>It is also future proof. The world around us is becoming more and more tech-filled so developer skills will be in high demand.</p>
